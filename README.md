# Advanced BMI Calculator (Python + Tkinter)

A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built with Python and Tkinter. This application enables users to calculate BMI, view historical data, and visualize BMI trends â€” all within an easy-to-use interface.

# Objective

To design and develop a user-friendly desktop application that:
-> Calculates BMI based on user input
-> Categorizes BMI into standard health classes
-> Stores data for multiple users
-> Displays historical BMI records
-> Visualizes trends through interactive charts

# Tools & Technologies Used

Tool/Library and their purpose 

1.Python -> Core programming language
2.Tkinter -> GUI development
3.Pandas -> Data storage & handling
4.Matplotlib -> Data visualization as graphs
5.Git & GitHub -> Version control & sharing

# Steps Performed

1. Designed a clean GUI using Tkinter
2. Collected user input (name, weight, height)
3. Calculated BMI and categorized it (underweight, normal, overweight, obese)
4. Stored user data locally in a `data.csv` file
5. Added features to:
   - View BMI history
   - Display BMI trend graph
6. Implemented input validation and error handling
7. Made the project portable and GitHub-ready

# How to Run
